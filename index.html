              Kurouzu-cho, a small fogbound town on the coast of Japan, is

              teenager Kirie Goshima, their town is haunted not by a person or
              being but by a pattern: uzumaki, the spiral, the hypnotic secret
              shape of the world. It manifests itself in everything from
              seashells and whirlpools in water to the spiral marks on people's
              bodies, the insane obsessions of Shuichi's father and the voice
              from the cochlea in our inner ear. As the madness spreads, the
              inhabitants of Kurouu-cho are pulled ever deeper into a whirlpool
              from which there is no return!
